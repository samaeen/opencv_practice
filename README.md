# OpenCV codes

Basic to some advanced level codes with python and opencv that I did while learning opencv.Most of the codes are based on the basic functions
of openCV that are available in the documentation.
The usual applications such as template matching,different type of object detecor,threshholding,canny images,face detection and recognition were put to use.
Most of the applications are self explanatory based on names of the folders.There is also a ocr application that uses tesseract ocr.
